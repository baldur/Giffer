  install redis and redis client

  start app
  node server.js <port>

  if you want to track things place a file in the modules directory and
  implement exports['hook'] which gets called with the request and you can
  manipulate it

  example 
    modules/ab.js
      
      export['hook'] = function(entry) {
          console.log('look I have an entry', entry);
          // do something more useful
      }
